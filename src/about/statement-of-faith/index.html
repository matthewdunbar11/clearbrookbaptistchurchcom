					<div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-push-2 col-md-10 col-md-push-1 col-xs-12"><h2 class="text-center">Statement of Faith</h2><p><strong>The Scriptures:</strong> We believe the Holy Bible, consisting of the Old and New Testaments only, in its oringinal languages to be the verbal-plenary inspired Word of God. We believe it to be the product of holy men as they were guided by the Holy Spirit; therefore, it is absolute truth without any admixture or error in all its content. We believe the Holy Bible to be the ultimate and final authority in personal faith, life, and manner of living. We believe that the Word of God is eternal, unchanging, and fully relevant for today&#8217;s world. We believe God has preserved his Word, for the English speaking people, in the Authorized Version (Commonly called, King James Versiion) of the Holy Scriptures. (Ps. 119:89, 160; Is. 40:8; John 17:17; 2 Tim. 3:16-17; Heb. 4:12; 1 Pet. 1:23-25; 2 Pet. 1:19-21)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The True God:</strong> We believe that there is only one living and true God, eternally existing in three Persons, the Holy Trinity; Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God is an infinite, transcendent Being, Creator and Sovereign over all creation, infinitely holy and glorious in His attributes, perfect in all His acts, unchanging in His natrue, self-existent, source of all life, and worthy of all possible worship, praise, honor, thanksgiving, glory, and faith. He is all knowing (omniscient), all powerful (omnipotent), and everywhere present at once (omnipresent). We believe the three Persons of the Godhead are equal in their possession of the essential attributes and perfections of God, perfectly harmonious in their counsel and acts, yet with differing functions and roles in fulfilling the purposes of God. (Gen. 1:1; Num. 23:19; Deut. 4:39; 6:4; 1 Kings 8:27; 1 Chron. 29:11-12; Ps. 18:30; 19:7-9; 102:25-27; 139:7-10; 145:17; Is. 45:18; 46:9-11; 57:15; Mal. 3:6; Matt. 28:19; John 4:24; Acts 17:24-28; Eph. 1:11; 1 Thess. 1:9; 1 Tim. 1:17; James 1:17; 1 John 5:7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Christ:</strong> We believe that Jesus Christ is the eternal second Person of the Godhead, fully God, fully man, the only begotten Son of God. We believe that as the only Redeemer of fallen humanity, he was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, and lived a sinless life. He offered Himself, once for all, as substitute for sinful mankind; shedding His life&#8217;s blood in making atonement for the sins of the world. In becoming sin for us He fully endured the wrath of God on our behalf. He was buried, resurrected bodliy, and ascended into Heaven where He currently makes intercession for us as our High Priest. He is coming again to receive His church unto Himself. Afterward, He will return to earth as King of kings and Lord of lords and as the glorious Messiah of Israel. He is the way, the truth, the life, and the only way to the Father. Salvation is through Him alone. (Is. 7:14; 9:6; Matt. 1:20-23; 20:28; Luke 1:26-35; John 1:1-3, 14, 29; 10:30; 14:6; Acts 1:1-11; 4:10-12; Phil. 2:4-11; Col. 1:15-16; 2:9; 1 Tim. 2:5; Heb. 1:3, 7:25-27; 10:10-14; Rev. 1:11; 5:8-14; 19:11-16)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Holy Spirit:</strong> We believe that the Holy Spirit is the eternal third Person of the Godhead, fully God, equal with the Father, equal with the Son. He was active in creation, currently restrains evil, bears witness to the Gospel of Jesus Christ in preaching and testimony, illuminates the truth of God’s Word, and convicts of sin, righteousness, and judgment. He regenerates and permanently indwells every person who believes on the Jesus Christ as personal Savior. He seals, sanctifies, intercedes, and helps the saints of God. His primary ministry is to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ. (John 3: 3 – 8; 14: 26; 15: 26; 16: 8 – 11, 14; Acts 5: 1 – 4; Romans 8: 26; Galatians 5: 17; 1st Corinthians 6: 19; 12: 11, 13; Ephesians 4: 30; 1st Thessalonians 5: 19; Titus 3: 5; Hebrews 10:29; Revelation 22: 19)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Creation:</strong> We believe the Genesis account of creation and that it is to be accepted literally and not as allegory or figurative language. We do not accept the Theory of Evolution as an explanation for the existence of the universe. We believe that man was initially created directly by God in the image of God and after His likeness. We believe that all other forms of life were created directly by God. We believe that the Lord established laws by which mankind, animal life, and all forms of vegetation should bring forth only after their kind. (Genesis 1 – 2; John 1: 3; Colossians 1: 16; Hebrews 11: 3).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Devil or Satan:</strong> We believe that Satan is a created being who once enjoyed great privileges in the presence of God. However, as a result of personal pride and desire to be as God, he fell and drew with him in his rebellion a third of the angels. We believe that he is the archenemy of God and His Christ, the accuser of the saints, mankind’s greatest tempter, the evil prince of the power of the air, the unholy god of this world, author of all false religions, the source of apostasy, and leader of the powers of darkness. He seeks to corrupt and destroy all that is God’s. His end is eternal judgment in the lake of fire which was prepared for him and his angels. (Isaiah 14: 12 – 14; Ezekiel 28: 13 – 17; Matthew 4: 1 – 11; John 8: 44; 2nd Corinthians 11: 14 – 15; Ephesians 6: 11 – 12; 1st Peter 5: 8; Revelation 12: 9 – 11; 20: 10)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fall of Man:</strong> We believe that man was created in a state of innocence, but due to a voluntary choice to disobey God’s command, he fell from his sinless and joyful state. As a result, all mankind was plunged into sin and its end result, death. Every person enters into this world spiritually dead (separated from God) and is destined to die physically (separation of spirit from body). We believe that the fall of man impacted every facet of his being, including his will. We believe that mankind is incapable of performing works of sufficient quantity and quality so as to merit personal righteousness before God. Therefore, every individual on the earth is in need of a Savior. We believe that the universe was cursed as a result of man’s fall into sin and will be restored by the Lord when He comes to establish His kingdom upon the earth. (Genesis 2: 17; 3: 1 – 19; Psalm 51: 5; Isaiah 64: 6; Jeremiah 17: 9; John 3: 18 – 21; Romans 1:18 – 32; 3: 10 – 20, 23; 5: 12 – 21; 8: 19 – 23; Ephesians 2: 1 – 9; Titus 3: 5 – 7; James 2: 26; Hebrews 9: 27)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Salvation:</strong> We believe that salvation is by the grace (unmerited favor) of God alone, through faith alone, in the Lord Jesus Christ alone. In obedience to the will of His Father, Jesus Christ willingly took upon Himself full human nature, yet without sin, completely fulfilled the Law of God, freely offered Himself as a full and substitutionary sacrifice for the entirety of man’s sins, the just for the unjust. Therefore, we have complete redemption and forgiveness of sins through His shed blood. It was His bodily resurrection, ascension back to Heaven, and glorification that demonstrates the Father’s acceptance of His work on our behalf. Salvation is a free gift, offered to all. However, salvation is initiated by God, and apart from Him drawing an individual to faith in Christ, none would come of their own volition. Salvation is promised to all who call upon the name of the Lord who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior. (John 3: 14 – 18, 36; 6: 44, 65; Romans 5:9; 10: 13; 2nd Corinthians 5: 21; Ephesians 2: 8 – 9; 1st Peter 1: 18 – 19; 2: 24; 1st John 2: 2; 4: 10)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Freeness of Salvation:</strong> We believe in election by God’s grace (not result of foreseen faith) and the gift of salvation that is made free to all by the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We believe in a general call and an effectual call to faith in Jesus Christ as Savior. We believe that it is the immediate responsibility of all to accept the free gift offered by God with a penitent and obedient faith. We believe that nothing prevents the greatest of sinners on earth from being saved but his/her own inherent depravity and voluntary rejection of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. (Acts 13: 48; Romans 8: 28 – 30; 9: 11, 21 – 23; Ephesians 1: 4, 11; 2nd Thessalonians 2: 13; 2nd Timothy 1: 9)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Justification Before God:</strong> We believe that justification before God is by faith and not of works. We believe that at the instant faith is placed in Christ that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to the account of the believer and he/she stands before God without condemnation or guilt. God sees the believer in perfections of Christ as if he/she had never sinned. (Romans 3: 24 – 31; 4:; Galatians 3: 11, 21 – 24; Ephesians 1: 6)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Security of the Believer:</strong> We believe that the redeemed are kept by the power of God and are secure in Jesus Christ. It is the gracious work of God on behalf of sinful mankind which guarantees that the gift of salvation, once received, can never be lost, and that believers are eternally secure. (John 10: 28 – 29; Ephesians 4: 30; Philippians 1: 6)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Heaven:</strong> We believe that Heaven is an actual place where those who have born again will dwell with God in eternal joy and blessing. (2nd Peter 3: 12 – 13; Revelation 21 – 22)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Eternal Punishment:</strong> We believe that Hell and the Lake of Fire are actual places. The Lake of Fire is where those who have rejected Jesus Christ as their personal Savior will dwell in a state of eternal punishment along with Satan, the Anti-Christ, the False Prophet, and fallen angels. (Matthew 25: 41, 46; Mark 9: 42 &#8211; 48; 2nd Thessalonians 1: 7 – 9; 2nd Peter 2: 4; Revelation 19: 20; 20: 10 – 15)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Church:</strong> We believe that Jesus Christ the builder of the church, which was started on the Day of Pentecost following His resurrection. We believe the universal church is the great number of people who have been regenerated and baptized with the Holy Spirit to form the “body” of Christ. We believe that the church is distinct from Israel, the redeemed Gentiles of other ages, and those redeemed during the tribulation period and millennial reign of Christ. We believe that the local church is a fellowship of saved, baptized people, which belong to a certain locality. We believe the mission of the church is to bear witness to the gospel of Jesus Christ locally and abroad, and to build the saints up in the faith. (Matthew 16: 18; Acts 2: 1 – 11; 11: 14 – 16; Romans 11; 14: 19; Ephesians 4: 12; 1st Corinthians 10: 32; 12: 12 – 13)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Two Ordinances of the Church:</strong> We believe that baptism is one of the two ordinances given to the church. We believe that immersion is the only Scriptural method which best identifies the believer with their Savior’s death, burial, and resurrection to newness of life. We believe its only prerequisite is saving faith in Jesus Christ. We do not believe baptism is necessary for salvation, but that it is an important act obedience and is the initial means by which a believer publicly declares his/her faith in and identification with Jesus Christ as personal Savior. We believe water baptism pictures spiritual baptism (Acts 2: 41; 8: 35 – 39; 11: 47 – 48; Romans 6: 3 – 5).</p>
<p>We believe the Lord’s Supper to be the church ordinance by which the Lord’s sacrificial death is commemorated until He comes again. The bread represents His body and the cup (grape juice) represents His shed blood. We do not believe in the doctrines of “transubstantiation” and “consubstantiation”. We believe that all believers who have been scripturally baptized and have carefully examined themselves can partake of the Lord’s Supper. (1st Corinthians 11: 23 – 32)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Offices of the Church:</strong> We believe that there are only two offices for the church, the pastor (also called bishop and elder) and deacon. (1st Timothy 3: 1 – 7, 8 – 13; Titus 1: 5 – 9; 1st Peter 5: 1 – 4).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Church Government:</strong> We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is the head of both the universal and the local church. We believe in the autonomy of the local church, therefore Clearbrook Baptist Church is independent of any council, convention, or denomination. We believe in fellowshipping with other sovereign, autonomous, independent, fundamental churches of like faith. We believe in the congregational form of government. (Matthew 18: 17; Acts 6: 3, 5; 11: 29 – 30; 15: 2, 3, 22; 1st Corinthians 5: 4, 5, 7, 13; 2nd Corinthians 8: 19; Ephesians 1: 22; 4: 15; 5: 23; Colossians 1: 18)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual Gifts:</strong> We believe that the spiritual gifts that were revelatory and confirmatory in purpose and function are no longer operative in the church today. The gifts of the office of apostle and New Testament prophet are no longer necessary since they were foundational to the church and because New Testament revelation is complete. Also, the need for the revelatory and confirmatory gifts no longer exists. The gift of tongues, as exhibited by adherents to the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements, is not scriptural in practice and purpose. We believe that every born-again believer has been given at least one spiritual gift for use in glorifying Jesus Christ and edifying the church, and is accountable to God for the stewardship of that gift(s). (Romans 12: 6 – 8; Ephesians 2: 20; 4: 11 – 16; 1st Corinthians 12: 1 – 14: 40; Hebrews 2: 3 – 4; 1st Peter 4: 10 – 11)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Missions:</strong> We believe the Lord commanded the church to be responsible for taking the Gospel to every person living on the face of the earth. Churches or their representatives (missionaries) are to go, make disciples, baptize them, and teach them the doctrines of the faith. (Matthew 28: 18 – 20; Mark 16: 15; Acts 13: 1 – 3; Romans 10: 13 – 15)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Eschatology:</strong> We believe in the imminent return of the Lord Jesus Christ to raise the dead in Christ and rapture the Church out of this world. This will be followed by a seven-year period of great tribulation upon the earth. At the conclusion of the tribulation period the Lord will return to earth with His saints to establish His millennial (1,000-year) kingdom on the earth, during which Satan is bound. During the Millennium the Lord will rule the earth as the Messiah of the restored nation of Israel. After the Millennium, Satan is released and allowed to deceive the nations for a brief period of time before he is consigned to the lake of fire forever. The unsaved will be judged at the Great White Throne and sentenced the lake of fire forever. (Isaiah 11: 1 – 16; 65: 17 – 25; Ezekiel 37: 1 – 48: 35; Zechariah 8:; 14:; Matthew 24: 3 – 25: 46; Mark: 13: 3 – 37; 1st Corinthians 15: 51 – 52; Philippians 3; 20 – 21; 1st Thessalonians 4: 13 – 17; Revelation 4: 1 – 22: 5)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Family:</strong> We believe that the family was the first institution ordained of God and consists of one man (husband) united to one woman (wife), by virtue of marriage, for as long as they shall live, and any children which God blesses to that union. We reject same-sex marriage as being unbiblical and contrary to God’s design for men and women. (Genesis 2: 24; Leviticus 18: 6 &#8211; 23; 20: 10 &#8211; 21; Mark: 10: 6 – 9; Romans 1: 26 – 27; Ephesians 5: 22 – 6: 4; Colossians 3; 18 – 21; 1st Peter 3: 1 &#8211; 7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Civil Government:</strong> We believe that civil government was the second institution ordained of God. Government exists for the promotion of order and the well-being of human society. Governmental leadership and authorities are to be honored and obeyed as long they do not stand in opposition to the moral will of God. (Genesis 9: 5 – 6; Matthew 22: 15 &#8211; 21; Mark 12: 14 – 17; Luke 20: 20 – 25; Acts 4: 19; 5: 29; 16: 35 – 40; Romans 13: 1 – 7; 1st Peter 2: 13 – 17)</p>
